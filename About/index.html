                <h2>Company Info</h2>
                <p> The journey is started from summer internship at Linux World, where we heard about "JAZBAA". Then, our mentor, Mr. Vimal Daga, instructed us to identify real-time problems and find solutions. He assigned us to a team of four. We brainstormed and presented our idea to him: creating a coding language that is accessible to everyone and can be used in native languages. Our mentor encouraged us to work on this idea. We then conducted fieldwork, developed its features, and began working on all aspects of the project, eventually giving it a name and platform.</p>
